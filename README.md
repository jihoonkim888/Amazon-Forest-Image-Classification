Download the dataset from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nF-oepVe1zAb-j2wN_oF4P_WJpU_rWt5/view?usp=sharing and decompress in the root folder as it is (CM50265-Group-Project/dataset). 

Alternatively, you can download the haze remove dataset from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kD53bkql9OACY-ye7NNEYUjiHdwepiYe/view?usp=sharing and set DATASET_PATH to "dataset-haze-removed/" in the notebook.


Please note that Google Drive does not allow you to directly download a file, which means we cannot download a dataset directly to a server. In this case, download the dataset on your local machine and use scp to transfer. For example,

```scp dataset.zip username@garlick.cs.bath.ac.uk:~/CM50265-Group-Project/```
